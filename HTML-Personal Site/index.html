  <p align='justify'>Born and raised in Haiti, Olivier has a bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering from National Taipei University of Technology.
    He is the eldest of a family of five brothers without sisters. In 2008 after graduating from high school, he got HELPR scholarship
    and started his undergraduate study in Telecommunications in Universite Quisqueya. After the 2010 earthquake he obtained another
    scholarship to go to Taiwan where he studied Chinese language and his electrical engineering bachelor degree</p>
  <p align='justify'>Olivier is seen by many people as being independent and self-obtained. He values the development of his intellectual
    awareness and the opportunity to learn, improve and grow. His ideas are generally abstract, containing intellectual insight, but he
    finds the practicalities of carrying out and developing these ideas to a conclusion less interesting. He likes to make sure that
    he knows what is going on and tries to make sure that everyone is pulling their weight. Under moderate tension, he is still able to reflect and become
    more efficient and effective. His knack for identifying and attending to key issues positions him well in dealing with an emergency. </p>
  <p align='justify'>He seeks to achieve perfection in most everything he does. He likes to make rules based on his own standards and to apply those rules to everyday life. He can
    always see room for improvement and may spend his relaxation time trying, as he sees it, to make himself, and others, better. He is seen by others
    as intellectually independent. He is persevering, with a singleness of purpose that he devotes to long term achievement of the mind. He is an ideal
    academic who continually seeks knowledge for its own sake. </p>
  <p align='justify'>He is keen to pick out logical inconsistencies. He is good at organising and bringing ideas into the plan. Both for himself and others
    , fun, relaxation and free time are scheduled and prioritised events. He assumes that everyone else should share his desire for
    advancement and may be disappointed when others appear to lack his strength of character. Because he is realist, he capitalises well on
    available resources, making him practical, with a good sense of timing. </p>
  <p align='justify'>He has a tendency to evaluate himself in order to minimize making critical mistakes. An original thinker, Olivier is highly observant
    and approaches his role with single-minded focus. He is conceptual, tenacious and realistic. Olivier's nature is to observe quietly
    and he appears to be collecting data on everything. However, when an emergency occurs, he can move swiftly to the root of the problem to deal with it
    expeditiously. He tries to use logical principles to make sense of the ideas that constantly arise in his mind. He focuses on truth, occuracy and productivity,
    but this can be seen by others as a rather one-sided commitment to his work.</p>
  <p align='justify'>Olivier is independent by nature, but he is prepared to labour tirelessly for a team mission he commits to. Once committed to an idea or project, Olivier
    has enormous resolve to carry it through and would like others to share his determination. Olivier believes in doing
    everything the right way and his preoccupation with perfection makes him sensitive to errors or unfairness. Logical, critical and ingenious, Olivier can see
    the consequences of the application of new ideas and has the perseverance to see pilot projects translated into reality. Developing
    , fostering, improving and honing his skills is likely to be life's work for him. </p>
